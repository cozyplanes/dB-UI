## About
**devBanner** is a collaboration project first started in devRant. It's aimed at creating personalized banners for everyone without using photo manipulation software. It currently creates personalized banners including your own subtext for devRant members using the devRant API.

## Current Features
- Your own subtext. You can write some lengthy subtext as well!
- Copyright-free. You don't need to worry about all the copyright problems.
- Lightweight. Most banners are under 50KB, so no problem downloading and using anywhere!

## Upcoming Features
- Improved banner designs
- Banner Size selection
- Wallpaper support

## I want one!
Looks like you are interested in creating your own banner, aren't you?

Well, it is easier than you think.

1. Open up your FAVORITE browser. We support way down until Netscape Navigator 7.20 ! (We have tried hard to achieve this.)
2. Head up to https://devbanner.center
3. You will be greeted by the beautiful, colorful frontend.
4. Fill in the form. You just have to type your devRant username and your own subtext. You can even write some nerd-y subtexts. (But we don't support xalgo..... Sorry)
5. After a few seconds, the generated banner will appear below. (In older browsers, it may open in another tab)
6. Right-click the image > Save As....
7. Use it everywhere!

(*Based on the frontend in Dec 27*)

## (Non-paid) Hire
We are looking for a front-end developer who can improve the overall designs and responsibility of our current frontend. Please contact via email or join the Gitter Chat by clicking the Chat on Gitter button above.
